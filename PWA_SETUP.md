3. Tap the **Share** button (square with arrow pointing up)
4. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
5. Name your app and tap **"Add"**
6. The app icon will appear on your home screen
7. Tap it to launch in standalone mode (no browser UI!)

### On Android:

1. **Open Chrome**
2. Visit your deployed site
3. You'll see an install banner automatically (or tap the menu ⋮)
4. Tap **"Install"** or **"Add to Home Screen"**
5. The app will be installed like a native app
6. Find it in your app drawer
7. Launch it for the full app experience!

### Desktop Testing:

1. **Open Chrome** (Chromium-based browsers)
2. Visit your site
3. Look for the install icon in the address bar (⊕ or ⬇)
4. Click to install
5. The app opens in its own window without browser chrome

## 🎨 Customization

### Change App Icon:

The current icon is an SVG located at `/public/icon.svg`. To customize:

1. Replace `/public/icon.svg` with your own design
2. For better compatibility, also generate PNG versions:
   ```bash
   # Using ImageMagick (if installed):
   convert -background none icon.svg -resize 192x192 icon-192.png
   convert -background none icon.svg -resize 512x512 icon-512.png
   ```
3. Update `/public/manifest.json` to reference PNG files if desired

### Change Theme Color:

Edit these files:

- `/public/manifest.json` - Change `theme_color` and `background_color`
- `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Update `themeColor` in metadata
- `/src/app/globals.css` - Update `:root` color variables

### Modify Navigation:

Edit `/src/components/shared/Navbar.tsx`:

- Add/remove navigation items
- Change icons
- Adjust styling

2. **Service Worker**: Automatically served from `/public`
3. **HTTPS Required**: PWAs require HTTPS (Vercel provides this)

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Add New App Shortcuts:

Edit `/public/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "shortcuts": [
    {
      "name": "Your Feature",
      "short_name": "Feature",
      "description": "Quick access to feature",
      "url": "/your-route",
      "icons": [{ "src": "/icon.svg", "sizes": "192x192" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

Remove `<PWAInstallPrompt />` from `/src/app/layout.tsx`
